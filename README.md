# Filler
Create your player program to compete against other students on the
famous (or not) Filler board. The principle is simple: two players take on each other on
a board, and take turns placing the piece that the master of the game (supplied in the
form of a Ruby executable) gives them, earning points. The game stops as soon as a
piece can no longer be placed. Little playful project!
